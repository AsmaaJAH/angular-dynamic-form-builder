Challenge: Dynamic JSON-Driven Form Builder

Your challenge is to build an Angular component that dynamically generates a form based on a JSON configuration. The form should:

✔️ Support various field types (text, email, password, select, checkbox, etc.).

✔️ Apply dynamic validation rules from the JSON schema.

✔️ Handle nested form groups and repeatable fields (e.g., hobbies list).

✔️ Provide real-time validation feedback to the user.

✔️ Include a live preview panel displaying form data as the user fills it out.

✔️ Submit the form and display a confirmation message.


⚡️ Bonus Features (Optional, Extra Points)

🚀 Async Validation: Implement an API-based validation for email uniqueness.

🚀 State Persistence: Store form progress in local storage.

🚀 Custom Directives/Pipes: Implement input formatting for specific fields.

🚀 Unit Testing: Write test cases for key form functionalities.



# DynamicFormBuilder

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
